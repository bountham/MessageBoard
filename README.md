#### Description

A simple message board app where users can input an event message and a group of users who know each other can view them and engage in social activities.

####Setup instructions

1.  **Clone this git repository:**


2.  **Use Composer to install required dependencies in the composer.json file:**

    2.1 In terminal window, change to the MessageBoard directory using `cd MessageBoard/`

    2.2 Install the dependencies in the composer.json file by typing `composer install`

3.  **Import the database schema:**

    3.1 Open a new terminal tab and start your postgres database by typing `postgres`

    3.2 Open a new terminal tab/window and type `psql` to enter the database command line

    3.3 Create a database named *message_board* by typing `CREATE DATABASE message_board;`

    3.4 Connect to the database with `\c message_board`

    3.5 Import the development database schema with `\i message_board.sql`

    3.6 Create the test database by running the SQL query `CREATE DATABASE message_test WITH TEMPLATE message_board;`

4.  **Set up your development server**

    4.1 In a new terminal tab/window, navigate to the `web` folder inside the `MessageBoard/` main project directory

    4.2 Start a php server by typing `php -S localhost:8000`

    4.3 Open a web browser and connect to the address `http://localhost:8000/`

#### Troubleshooting

If the database schema import doesn't work you can manually create the Postgres database on your local machine using the following Postgres commands.

**Note:** The application has **not** been tested to work with MySQL.

```sql
  CREATE DATABASE message_board;

  \c message_board

  CREATE TABLE messages (id serial PRIMARY KEY, message varchar, created timestamp, user_id int);
  CREATE TABLE tags (id serial PRIMARY KEY, name varchar);
  CREATE TABLE users (id serial PRIMARY KEY, name varchar, password varchar, admin boolean);
  CREATE TABLE messages_tags (id serial PRIMARY KEY, message_id int, tag_id int);

  CREATE DATABASE message_test WITH TEMPLATE message_board;
```

If the database is throwing Connection refused exceptions, try editing the PDO instantiation line to include the username and password of the postgres user the message_board database was created by.


**app.php line 10** before revision

```php
<?php
#...
$DB = new PDO('pgsql:host=localhost;dbname=message_board');
```

**app.php line 10** with user and pass

```php
<?php
#...
$DB = new PDO('pgsql:host=localhost;dbname=message_board',
  "<your_username>", "<your_password>");
```
